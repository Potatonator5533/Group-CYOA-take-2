// Names: Brandon, Josue, Sinatha

// Lab Name: Group CYOA with Styles
// Brief Description: Used HTML elements and CSS styling to make a choose your own adventure game. 
// Edited CYOA after Isaiah's peer review. 10/20/23
// Peer Reviewer: Isaiah Ferguson
// Comments: <title> tag content should be changed from Document. The page where you decide to leave the property and then it immediately says you quit being a detective seems rushed / doesn't make to much sense to me. Your team has over 24 hours to turn this in, I believe it can be styled a bit better. you can always look to other websites for inspiration. but overall good job on the CYOA.
